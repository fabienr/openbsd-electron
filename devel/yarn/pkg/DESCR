Yarn is a package manager for your code. It allows you to use and share
(e.g. JavaScript) code with other developers from around the world.

Fast: Yarn caches every package it has downloaded, so it never needs to
download the same package again. It also does almost everything concurrently to
maximize resource utilization. This means even faster installs.

Reliable: Using a detailed but concise lockfile format and a deterministic
algorithm for install operations, Yarn is able to guarantee that any
installation that works on one system will work exactly the same on another
system.

Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package
before its code is executed.

N.B. This package of yarn 1.x provides "Yarn Classic" which can be fetched
with a simple download, but is in maintenance mode and has been for some time.
Current versions, "Yarn Modern", should be installed per-project via the
"corepack" tool instead.
