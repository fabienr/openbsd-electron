The break time reminder app

Stretchly is a cross-platform open source app that reminds you to
take breaks when working on your computer.

When you run Stretchly for the first time, you are presented with
a Welcome window that allows you to change the language, review the
preferences, view the online tutorial or simply continue with the
default preferences.

Stretchly itself lives in your tray, only displaying a reminder
window from time to time, which contains an idea for a break.

By default, there is a 20 second Mini Break every 10 minutes and a
5 minute Long Break every 30 minutes (after 2 Mini Breaks).

You'll be notified 10 seconds before a Mini Break (and 30 seconds
before a Long Break) so that you can prepare to pause your work.

When a break starts, you can postpone it once for 2 minutes (Mini
Breaks) or 5 minutes (Long Breaks). Then, after a specific time
interval passes, you can skip the break. Both actions are available
by clicking on the link at the bottom of window or by using the
Ctrl/Cmd + X keyboard shortcut.
